# Colourful Image Colourisation
## Objective
Replicating and improving upon the Colorful Image Colorization paper by Richard Zhang found as **paper.pdf** in this repo. Further, improving the accuracy of the model by using transfer learning and adding more datapoints to the ImageNet dataset used in in this paper. Finally, using the model to de-oldify user images by making a web app using Flask and hosting on Heroku.
